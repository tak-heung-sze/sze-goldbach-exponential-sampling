## Overview

This repository contains the research paper and supporting materials for:

> **A Low-Variance Exponential Sampling Platform for Empirical Testing of the Hardy–Littlewood Goldbach Heuristic**

The work introduces a **deterministic exponential subsequence**
\[
a(n) = 9 \cdot 2^n
\]
(referred to as the *Sze exponential sequence*) as a **low-variance empirical platform** for testing asymptotic heuristics in additive prime number theory, with specific focus on the Hardy–Littlewood Goldbach heuristic.

The contribution is **methodological rather than conjectural**:  
the sequence reduces sampling noise while preserving the relevant arithmetic structure, enabling clearer observation of slow asymptotic convergence behavior.
